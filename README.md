Solutions to the https://adventofcode.com/ puzzles

## 2016
These are in C++11 and there's a Linux and G++ Makefile provided.
I've just copied these files in from an older repo from back in those years.
Looks like I got nearly all done except the day 25 part 2.

## 2017
These are in C++14 and there's a Linux and G++ Makefile provided.
I've just copied these files in from an older repo from back in those years.
Only got 10 days done.

## 2018
There are written in Rust stable 1.39.0 from 2019-11-04.
These I completed in the days leading up to 1 December 2019.
I wanted to get a Crate etc. setup so I'd be ready to start on the 2019 puzzles.
Also, I wanted to learn some of the Rust graph libraries so I'd have a handle on them
for the later 2019 puzzles that (I'm sure) will need graph algorithms.

## 2019
Hmmm.... didn't write many notes here...

## 2020
Well what a year hey!
I've learnt a bit of Rust, and been brushing up on my number theory
so I hope I don't get so stuck towards the end as I did last year.
I should still go back and fix up the 2019 answers...

For me, the puzzles are released at 3PM - so most weekdays I'll be
doing these at work.

I've also started re-doing some of the 2019 puzzles to try
and have some ready solutions to expected issues....

Notes about each day:

1. Finding one combination from a list of integers.
   * Was interrupted just before 3PM and didn't get to start this
     on time.
   * I first solved this with 2/3 nested loops.
   * However, I had Itertools ready as I knew part 2 could get more
     difficult - but it didn't.
   * Refactored to use Itertools after submitting. It's a little slower,
     but fine in release mode.
2. Parsing input then checking "passwords" based on parsed data.
   * 13m/17m - Bad.
   * I knew parsing in Rust is not straight forward, and
     didn't have this ready. Not really impressed with myself.
     Will be spending tonight getting some parsing stuff ready for future
     puzzles.
