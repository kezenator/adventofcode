Solutions to the https://adventofcode.com/ puzzles

## 2016
These are in C++11 and there's a Linux and G++ Makefile provided.
I've just copied these files in from an older repo from back in those years.
Looks like I got nearly all done except the day 25 part 2.

## 2017
These are in C++14 and there's a Linux and G++ Makefile provided.
I've just copied these files in from an older repo from back in those years.
Only got 10 days done.

## 2018
There are written in Rust stable 1.39.0 from 2019-11-04.
These I completed in the days leading up to 1 December 2019.
I wanted to get a Crate etc. setup so I'd be ready to start on the 2019 puzzles.
Also, I wanted to learn some of the Rust graph libraries so I'd have a handle on them
for the later 2019 puzzles that (I'm sure) will need graph algorithms.

## 2019
About to start....
